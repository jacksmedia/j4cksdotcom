# Discord social media app

## What and why

In the 2020s, social media is increasingly organized by communities, and [Discord](https://www.discord.com) is a popular platform for many of them.

- [Replying directly to specific messages](/docs/tutorial-discord/discord-reply)

- Inviting others to the server

- Inserting custom media (GIFs and emojis)

Guides to all 3 of these will appear soon!

## Some advanced tips like:

- logging in across multiple devices

- copying emojis from one community to another

Will also be offered, if you're interested in really getting the most out of this dynamic and thematic social experience!
