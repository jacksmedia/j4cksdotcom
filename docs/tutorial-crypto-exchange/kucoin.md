# KuCoin Centralized Exchange

## Why use a CEX?

Thought this was all about decentralization, anon? Well ideally, of course it is! We all want to escape from the status quo and live in a world that's not controlled by banks. Yet there's no DEX to swap Ravencoin into EGLD, not in 2023Q2. So until this option exists, let's utilize the best option at hand, [KuCoin Exchange \(🇭🇰\)](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=r3JHB3C&lang=en_US&utm_source=friendInvite).

You can also find $RVN on [Binance US \(🗺️\), join here if applicable & interested](https://accounts.binance.us/en/register?ref=52116724). This is another great and fast way to convert $RVN to $EGLD, and allow your mining rig to augment your staking on MultiversX.

## Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe

Alternatively, you can keep your $RVN under your own control with the free, "Your Keys Your Coins" [Trust Wallet app](https://trustwallet.com). It may also be possible to use a hardware wallet to store your Ravencoin, but this author cannot confirm this method at this time.
