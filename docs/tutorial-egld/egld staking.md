# EGLD Staking

## What is Staking?
A lot of people still don't appreciate Staking eGold! Why aren’t you earning crypto from your dragon’s hoard of EGLD?

Staking eGold temporarily locks up your money, but rewards you with free money because your EGLD is helping validate the MultiversX network.

Yes, seriously-- it’s free money and you can keep compounding it… much like Traditional Finance (TradFi), Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is structured to reward investment in the system.

## Sounds good. What kind of APY is offered?

Anywhere between 8 and 12%, surprisingly! Rates change often, yet are clearly displayed in the xPortal app and on the xExchange.

Your rewards are paid in EGLD (and more*), [accrue daily](https://help.maiar.com/en/articles/5080071-when-are-rewards-distributed), and can be claimed right from the app.

This compares very well to [other blockchains](https://defirate.com/staking/sol), which do not pay staking rewards for multiple days.

## How do I stake eGold?
1. Get the [xPortal Wallet](https://xport.al/referral/o6q0in3yh6/), see the previous page. 

2. Download and then open xPortal app, to access the MultiversX. 

3. Add some EGLD if needed– you must begin with at least 1, but you can compound much smaller amounts along the way; at time of writing this represents about US$44.

4. Choose Earn. Select a staking provider from the official list and store some eGold away to begin accumulating rewards immediately.

## But wait, there's Metastaking Too
Until this warrants its own piece, here's another idea that's similar to staking. It's a kind of investment by token, versus $EGLD, so check this out on [xexchange.com](https://www.xexchange.com) if you are curious.

I'm choosing to "farm" $UTK tokens. There are many options. You can claim rewards or Reinvest (seen here) to keep compounding interest!
