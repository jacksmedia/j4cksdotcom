# AI Art: Midjourney Advanced

Once you have a grasp of the basic **/imagine** and **/blend** tools in MJ, it's time to combine them into one technique. This isn't explicitly detailed anywhere in the docs I've seen ([📧 let me know](https://twitter.com/xJ4cks) where, if I'm missing it!) so I'm pleased to share this with you.

## Blend Images + Prompt

![step 0 of the full blend technique](./full-blend-1.png)
> Let's assume you have 2 or more images that you like, and you want to blend elements of them together WITHOUT losing the impact and details of the cool prompt that made them. There's an easy way to do this but it's not obvious, so read on!

![step 1 of the full blend technique](./full-blend-2.png)
> If you use the **/blend** command on 2 outputs and lose some elements that you want, this is exactly the technique that will help you.

![step 2 of the full blend technique](./full-blend-3.png)
> Because we can see how this **/blend** lost track of the dynamic pose (and so much more 🤦‍♂️), let's use the "full blend" hacky trick to get the prompt back in there, too!

![step 3 of the full blend technique](./full-blend-4.png)
> <i><b>Upload</b> any images you want</i>, use the "⊕" button and they'll show up in Discord. Can't get more direct than this, right??

![step 4 of the full blend technique](./full-blend-5.png)
> *Retrieve the images' URLs*. Open them in a new tab, and copy/pasta them into your prompt...

![step 5 of the full blend technique](./full-blend-6.png)
> All set, go ahead and **/imagine w this full prompt**! That's all there is to this hack! 😹 Now MJ can reference both the source images and the original prompt used to create them.

This technique seems to offer a much more fine-tuned "full blend" informed by both text and picture, and I suggest you try it to enhance your workflow!

Here is the prompt w the exact image links I used in this example. IDK if the MJ links will last very long, but give it a try with your own images ofc!

Enjoy and remember to share this new art movement with your frens. Maybe invite the Midjourney bot to your home Discord server, too...
