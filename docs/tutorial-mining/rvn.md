# Ravencoin GPU Mining

## Why Mine?

Ravencoin is an upgraded Bitcoin-type blockchain that's designed to elude ASIC (professional) mining. It's still possible to mine $RVN & it's become more popular than ever with the end of mining for stake on Ethereum (2022Q3).

## How to Mine

You can read [this guide](https://miningravencoin.com/) to learn the basic mining approach. You will also need the free, "Your Keys Your Coins" [Trust Wallet app](https://trustwallet.com) to access your Ravencoin. Alternatively, you can perhaps mine directly to a centralized exchange wallet like KuCoin.
