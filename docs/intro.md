# What is on this site?

Guides to learning the basics of new tools, mainly. Discord and Notion are both incredibly powerful communication and community apps, so I use them daily and want to share some onramps so that you can start using them, too.

[Notion](https://notion.so) is a webpage builder and [Discord](https://discord.com) is a messaging platform. With Discord you can connect with like-minded people and with Notion you can promote anything you wish, products or ideas or media or whatever. They are both completely free to use, and they both are powered by famously small teams so they are useful, innovative, and responsive to user feedback.
