# Ravencoin GPU Mining

## Why Mine?

Ravencoin is an upgraded Bitcoin-type blockchain that's designed to elude ASIC (professional) mining. It's still possible to mine $RVN & it's become more popular than ever with the end of mining for stake on Ethereum (2022Q3).

## Why Mine

Especially during the colder months, the heat that a GPU rig emits will surprise you! The 4 card mining rig I am running this winter has cut my heating bill by about 0.5 $EGLD a month, so when you factor in the whole shebang, mining crypto is profitable in winter!

## How to Mine

Stay tuned, step-by-step guides are getting imported from another site of mine by November. Thanks for you interest in mining ravencoin!
