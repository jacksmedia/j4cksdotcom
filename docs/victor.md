# Give a Few Bucks to Victor

![Super Victor Coin](@site/static/img/blaz-svcoin.gif)

He's a kid who needs to raise money to pay for his medicine, and it's only a few months left before it's too late.

Wen you have leftover EGLD consider buying [some of ðŸŽ«these ticketsðŸŽ«](https://www.frameit.gg/marketplace/nft/VICLOTTERY-19f055-01/19772) because you will help save this kid's life w the residual NFT income, and you'll be entered into a huge EGLD lotto at the end of the fundraising drive. The ROI from the jackpot is a bit too much for me to calculate, but this is a worthy cause so you're winning just by playing, and it could change your life if you win. There will be 10 winners!

You can also donate through [GoFundMe](https://t.co/rDIlJpwmHT). Thanks for considering it!
