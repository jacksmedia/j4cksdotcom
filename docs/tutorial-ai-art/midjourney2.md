# AI Art: Midjourney Basics, Cont'd

Interested in going deeper than prompting your imagination with words? Try the second popular mode, introduced early 2023 in Midjourney version 4, the **/blend**.

> These images were crafted from 2 other images, without a word prompt.

## /blend not /imagine
A novel feature introduced in version 4 is the */blend* command. Use this instead of **/imagine** and it will request /image1 & /image2. Upload these and you'll receive 4 mashups of the two visuals, which is most useful over several attempts, or to refine a good idea by adding some new colors or motifs.

## How to Blend
- 1️⃣ Go to the Midjourney chat in your server. You can also DM with the MJ bot instead of doing the prompts in a public room, yet you'll learn more working in public.
- 2️⃣ type in */blend*
- ![blend will fuse 2 images without the need for words](./blen.png)
- 3️⃣ the *uploads* will show up, choose 2 or more images from your device to upload and that's it!

In this example I chose a pommes frites & a diamond NewDegenOrder pyramid.

Behold their ineffable blended result! This was after I pushed **V** a few times on the blend output, and then **Upscaled** my favorite one.

Enjoy and remember to share this new art movement with your friends.
