# Get Into Crypto, Wallets 101

The [xPortal Wallet](https://xport.al/referral/o6q0in3yh6/) (formerly Maiar app) will unlock the MultiversX blockchain, the best place to start learning about & enjoying cryptocurrency! The currency here is called eGold, versus Bitcoin or Ethereum on other chains. Because it's cheaper and safer than Ethereum, and because it can run apps unlike Bitcoin, eGold on MultiversX is the most interesting current crypto.

MetaMask and Trust Wallet are the same overall approach to interacting with a blockchain, but they're not needed in MultiversX. It's the same idea, but on a safer, smarter tech layer: you control a single "wallet" that's an address like an email or a phone number. These wallets are usually very long, but there's new ways to alias them with vanity names, or even make them into URLs.
