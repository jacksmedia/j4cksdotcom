# EGLD, digital gold

## What is eGold?

The currency EGLD exists as a robust, multi-sharded metadata record on the Elrond blockchain. (The upcoming rebrand will be MultiversX, but the currency will remain eGold.) It excels as a store of value, a financial utility, and a programmatic resource, due to unusually good blockchain design.

## How to get some EGLD?

You can buy it from the [Maiar App](https://maiar.com/), and you can also purchase at the [elrond.com](https://www.elrond.com) site. Once you have EGLD then you can see it in your wallet (a unique address, like an email account) and you can interact with it from the [wallet.elrond.com](https://wallet.elrond.com) website and or the [Maiar Wallet](https://maiar.com/) (soon to be xWallet).

Individual wallets send and receive blockchain data, and there is a decentralized financial system built around using EGLD. The central Maiar Exchange (soon to be xPortal) uses EGLD to provide lending services (liquidity) for EGLD and other cryptos. Other exchanges exist to provide extra features, currencies, and tools, such as [ashswap](https://ashswap.io/), [arda.run](https://arda.run), [jexchange.io](https://jexchange.io).

## Why EGLD, Why MvX?

+ easy earnings
+ best in class blockchain architecture
+ best in class ecosystem of wallet + dapps

You can stake EGLD at 10% APY right in the Maiar App (xWallet) and you can swap it into many other cryptos with interesting projects and utilities implemented (or planned) in these exchanges. MultiversX boasts the largest number of nodes (physical computing centers, processing records and providing redundancy) of any current decentralized blockchain. The ease of the wallet app combined with the security and speed of the web3 dapps is what makes MvX (Elrond) stand out from other ecosystems like Cosmos, Cardano, Solana, and Ethereum.
