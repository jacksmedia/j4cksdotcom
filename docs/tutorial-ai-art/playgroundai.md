# AI Art: Playground Basics

[Playground AI](https://playgroundai.com/create) is a deployment of open-source tools like Stable Diffusion that's available online, with generous free credits. This guide will get you moving forward, and then you can learn more as you go.

## How to Start
- 1️⃣ Feed it an image prompt, as if it were Midjourney. Expect rougher results.
- 2️⃣ Experiment with the different engines, save good stuff.

## Now for Image to Image
This is just magic, there's no need to get too technical about it. 

1. Choose one of the good results you've made with Playground or Midjourney and upload it with the *Image to Image* button in the bottom of the left panel.

2. Control how much (30 is the start) influence you want the Image you're uploading to have on the Image you're prompting (image strength slider).

3. Add a Prompt up top as usual: the output will get steered by the uploaded image! Experiment, and discover.

> "castle complex, insanely detailed line art, isekai, anime style, hand drawn style, cel shading, hyper maximalist, dystopian, victorian, cyberpunk" at Image strength 46

> Same prompt, but one tick higher at 47! This seems like a borderline to me, your results will vary.

Remember to share this new art movement with your frens!
