# 2023 Reflections on My web3 Experience

I'm still semi-active (no longer daily, hourly) on ([Crypto Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/xJ4cks)) and I'm increasingly following ppl who represent Aiart or other interests tangential to NFTs and DAOs (decentralised, autonomous orgs). 

What's with the M shaped pastel emoji ghost up there? It's from an NFTProject I'm curious about lately, one that pays out fractional income rewards (in EGLD!) monthly, sourced from a web2 biz. Each MaiarGhost (MxGhost) from [https://ghostverse.org/](https://Ghostverse.org) is unique, and this one just happens to be blissed out at sunrise on an airfield. Narratives abound.

## But J4cks, why does web3 matter, when the world doesn't rage about and crave crypto right now? Two related reasons, anon:

### 1. Stacking

It's a great time to network and to invest. Because the few teams that are still building through this drought will become the leaders of the next wave of interest and passion, it's a smart time to learn who's who on your favorite blockchain. Mine's MultiversX, so I'm focusing my guides on its tools and apps. Research which of the 21st-century teams on your chain seem the most likely to succeed in their roadmaps, and acquire more of their tokens and/or NFTs.

### 2. Buidling

The bars to entry are down. Because the bulls aren't raging in 2023Q1, it's a smart time to learn the ropes of how to contribute to a web3 project. You can also learn how to implement a DAO, because these new workplaces and org types are not going anywhere, and they're eager for labor. Mentee yourself to someone you want to shadow, or actively volunteer your talents as you learn some new technologies (stable diffusion? Notion? Twitter Spaces?).

### DAOs on MX

A few true DAOs exist on MultiversX, as of 2023Q1. [ElrondBuddies](https://www.elrondbuddies.com/) is one notable club that assigns votes via NFT & per NFT, and its community helps steer the roadmap actions by voting with the powers given by [peerme.io](https://peerme.io/peerings/create). Other NFT clubs may be doing this, yet I cannot vouch for it. Lannuvar SubDAO is considering it.

New killer app [xSafe](https://xsafe.io/) creates wallets (vaults) using multisig logic and is already inside of the xPortal app. Users generate inexpensive  multi-signature (multisig) vaults in order to share the executive control of funds or NFTs between two or more MultiversX accounts. This is ideal for web3 treasuries, and we are pursuing it in the Lannuvar SubDAO.
