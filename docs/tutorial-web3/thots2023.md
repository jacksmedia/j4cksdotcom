I'm still semi-active (no longer daily, hourly) on ([Crypto Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/xJ4cks)) and I'm increasingly following ppl who represent Aiart or other interests tangential to NFTs and DAOs. 

What's with the M shaped pastel emoji ghost up there? It's from a new NFTProject I'm curious about lately, one that pays out franctional income rewards (in EGLD!) monthly, sourced from a web2 biz. Each MaiarGhost (MxGhost) from [https://ghostverse.org/](Ghostverse.org) is unique, and this one just happens to be blissed out at sunrise on an airfield. Narratives abound.

Why does web3 matter, when the world doesn't rage about and crave crypto right now? Two reasons:

1. It's a great time to network and to contribute. Because the few teams that are still building through this drought will become the leaders of the next wave of interest and passion, it's a smart time to learn who's who on your favorite blockchain. (Mine's MultiversX, so I'm focusing my guides on its tools and apps.)

2. The bars to entry are down. It's a great time to learn the ropes of how to contribute to a web3 Project or how to implement a DAO, because these new workplaces and org types are not going anywhere, and they're eager for labor.

Does it frustrate me that no true DAO exists yet on MultiversX? Absolutely. We'll see one before the year is out, though, as new apps using the multisig logic are affordable and available now, such as [peerme.io](https://peerme.io/peerings/create) and [xSafe](https://xsafe.io/). At least three organizations are pursuing it, as far as I'm aware-- dozens are, surely. A new ["Project X"](https://twitter.com/projectx_off?lang=en) type of fundraising launch has been announced, which aims to secure multisig as part of its main Roadmap and raison d'etre.
